# Line-Segment-Detector-using-OpenCV

![Result](images/result.png)


## Principle: 
**LSD** is a linear-time line segment algorithm giving subpixel accurate results. It detects locally straight contours on images. The algorithm starts by computing the ***level-line angle*** at each pixel to produce a ***level line field***. This field is then segmented into connected region of pixels that share the same level-line angle upto a certain degree of tolerance (Ï„), called ***line-support regions***. 
The older algorithms like Hough transform which uses Canny filter have a lot of false detections. Ignoring the orientation of the edge points,
such algorithms obtain line segments with aberrant direction. Compared to this, LSD uses much stable approach of **Helmholtz principle**, according to which an observed geometric structure is of significance, only when it's noise expectation is less than 1.

## Compilation and Dependencies

The LSD algorithm is written in C++ and uses [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library.
To build the files, [CMake](https://cmake.org/) has been used.
During compilation create a new directory called **build** in the main directory.

## Usage
   Linux

- cmake ..
- make

This will create ./LSD file in the build directory. Run ./LSD to run the application.
